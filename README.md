# Food Calorie Tracker App 
This is a food tracker built in Flask (python), HTML and CSS. It is meant to be a rudimentary tool for users to track the items they consumed over the course of a day. It resembles popular fitness applications such as MyFitnessPal and Cronometer. 

# Implementation
Setup your virtual environment (consult this documentation here if confused https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h9w0meM8i4&t=481s&ab_channel=ShwetaLodhaShwetaLodha). Follow this with the command: 
### 'pip install flask' 
install flasksqlalchemy, then run 
### 'flask run'
the page should establish a localhost connection and update with changes!
